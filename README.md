This repository contains code and materials for the first week's challenge of the 10 Academy's Data Engineering (DE), Generative AI Engineering (AIE), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) training program.

Overview

The goal of this challenge is to analyze solar radiation data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo to identify high-potential regions for solar installations. The dataset includes measurements of global horizontal irradiance (GHI), direct normal irradiance (DNI), diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI), ambient temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and other relevant variables.
